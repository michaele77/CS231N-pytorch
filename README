README


This folder contains all of the big tests/sims I ran on both drive using colab and GCP

In general, everything inside each seed will follow the previous data structuring format. The only difference is that seeds might have a different suffix if taken from drive.

I will add a testing folder within each seed (if not created already) that will have loss plots, comparison pictures, and inception score plots for different runs and different trainings.
