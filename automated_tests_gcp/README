README


This folder contains all of the big tests/sims I ran on both drive using colab and GCP

In general, everything inside each seed will follow the previous data structuring format. The only difference is that seeds might have a different suffix if taken from drive.

I will add a testing folder within each seed (if not created already) that will have loss plots, comparison pictures, and inception score plots for different runs and different trainings.


The following are descriptions of different seeds:

seed_1
-5/24, the first run I tried on GCP with 20 different seeds
-30 epochs, half and half decay
-Broadest spread, will use this and the drive one to narrow down

seed_0
-5/20? The 16ish runs I did on drive before colab kicked me out
-16 epochs, half and half decay
-Will use as a backup in case the seed_1 doesnt give enough conclusive results

seed_2
-5/25, initiated with learnings from seed_1
-Increased to 100 epochs, half and half decay
-Narrowed to only using wgang loss
-increased LR spread to 1.5-4e-4 (up from 1-3e-3)
-Increased beta spread to 0.2 to 0.8 (up from 0.3 to 0.7, didnt get great data capture before)
-Increase save_epoch freq to every 10
-After this, will try to narrow down, might spread to pool parameter, might lengthen epoch (ie 300 or 400)
